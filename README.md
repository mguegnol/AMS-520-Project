# AMS-520-Project
## Combining (deep) reinforcement learning and goals based investing in QWIM - FinRL

# Reinforcement Learning algorithms
Reinforcement learning is a machine learning training strategy that rewards desirable actions while penalizing undesirable ones. A reinforcement learning agent can sense and comprehend its surroundings, act, and learn via trial and error in general.

The RL algorithm in FinRL is based on openai/baselines. Those are
 - [A2C](https://github.com/openai/baselines/tree/master/baselines/a2c)
 - [PPO](https://github.com/openai/baselines/tree/master/baselines/ppo2)
 - [DDPG](https://github.com/openai/baselines/tree/master/baselines/ddpg)

In financial world, the reinforcement learning try every steps of states and update policy depends on the choosen algorithm. 

# Features engineering
Technical indicators are heuristic or pattern-based indications generated by a security's or contract's price, volume, and/or open interest, which are employed by traders who apply technical analysis. Technical analysts utilize indicators to forecast future price changes by evaluating previous data.

The most of them are momentum indicator. A momentum indicator (oscillator) is a technical indicator that compares current and previous values to illustrate trend direction and assess the rate of price variation. It is one of the main indicators for determining the pace at which securities move. In most cases, a momentum indicator is utilized in conjunction with other indicators.

The technical indicators that is used in this project are MACD, BOLL, RSI, CCI, ADX. 
- MACD = EMA(TP,13) − EMA(TP,26)
- BOLLU = MA(TP,20)+2∗stdDev(TP,20)
- BOLLD = MA(TP,20)−2∗stdDev(TP,20)
- RSI = 100-(100/(1+ave. gain/ave.loss))
- CCI = (TP - SMA(TP,20)) / (.015 x Mean Deviation(TP,20))
- ADX = |+DI- -DI|/|+DI + -DI| *100

# Data source
The data souce is from yfinance, which is based on data from yahoo finance.

# RL parameter
	["batch_size","buffer_size","learning_rate","total_timesteps"]

# Backtesting
We use the 60 days as lookback range for 4 years. We use Quantstats for the performance report.
